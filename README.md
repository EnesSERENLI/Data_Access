# Ado.NET
ADO.NET acts as a complete Bridge between our application that we will develop and the Database. We can read and update data. We can run SQL queries and procedures. For this reason, ADO.NET is the most important technology that we should use in all our database-related application.

# ORM (Object Relational Mapping)

* It gives the opportunity to write code in accordance with object-oriented programming standards.
* It provides the opportunity to perform database operations with minimum SQL knowledge.
* There is no database platform dependency. We can seamlessly migrate MSSQL while using Oracle.
* It is more secure against Ado.net. There are security measures against known attacks such as Sql Injection.
* It reduces the time to write code.
* Increases code readability.

# EntityFrameWork

It is one of the ORM(Object Relational Mapping) tools.
Just as ORM is like a bridge between OOP and relational database, EF is a construct where we use our object models to manage our information in relational database.
